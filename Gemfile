gemspec

# Declare any dependencies that are still in development here instead of in
# your gemspec. These might include edge Rails or gems from your path or
# Git. Remember to move these dependencies to your gemspec before releasing
# your gem to rubygems.org.

# To use a debugger
# gem 'byebug', group: [:development, :test]
gem 'awesome_print'

# For Keyword Search -- have to include these in the gemfile so they work in the dummy app
gem 'sunspot_rails' 
gem 'sunspot_solr'
